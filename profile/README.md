# UB-SPEBT

## Repositories
- ### matrix-calc
    This repository holds the `C++`/`CUDA` code for the analytical calculation of the system matrix of the SPECT scanner model.
- ### image-reconstruction
    Repository for the image reconstruction code, including
    `Python` implementation for:
    1. ***Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (ML-EM)*** algorithm.
    2. ***Maximum a Posteriori Reconstruction (MAP)*** algorithm

- ### reconEvaluation
    Repository for the evaluation of the image reconstruction.
    The repository contains:

    1. `Python` implementation to calculation the ***Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR)***
    2. `Python` implementation to calculation the ***Local Impulse Response (LIR)***

- ### systemMatrixEval
    The repository contains the codes for evaluating the System Response Matrix directly.
    
    #### Projection Probability Density Function Analysis

- ### UB-SPEBT-utils
    The repository contains codes for common tasks in the UB-SPEBT project.

    #### SPEBT scanner model configuration files
    - `JSONC` tree-like format
    - `JSON` flat format
